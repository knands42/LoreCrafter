# LoreCrafter API Documentation
## 📘 Project Overview
LoreCrafter is an AI-powered platform designed to assist RPG players in creating rich, immersive content for their games — including characters, worlds, and campaigns. Each element is generated with deep narrative structure and thematic consistency to support long-term storytelling.

Players can create and customize content, link it together, and optionally share it publicly for the community to explore and reuse in their own adventures.

## 🎭 Characters
Characters are generated with AI-driven backstories, personalities, and visual descriptions that align with the user's specified themes and tone.

### 🔗 Linking to Worlds
Characters can be linked to an existing user-created or publicly shared world. When creating a new character, users have the option to browse and list their own worlds or explore public ones to establish context and connections.

### 📄 Export to PDF
Once a character is created, users can export a character sheet as a PDF, including the generated narrative and key traits — perfect for printing or sharing during RPG sessions.

## 🌍 Worlds
Worlds serve as foundational settings, featuring AI-generated history, timelines, and cultural context tailored to the player's vision.

### 🔗 Linking in Other Creations
When creating a character or campaign, users can easily select from a list of their own worlds or publicly available ones to ensure coherence and reusability across projects.

## 🗺️ Campaigns
Campaigns combine narrative setups, NPCs, and hidden plot elements, all generated to match your desired universe and tone.

### 🔗 Linking Characters and Worlds
Campaigns can be linked to a specific world and one or more existing characters. During creation, users can list and select from their own assets or explore shared/public options.

### 🌐 Sharing Publicly
Once a campaign is created, users can choose to make it public so others can discover, clone, or draw inspiration from it. This promotes collaborative storytelling and a richer shared experience.
